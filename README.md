# IGACSE (Interactive Graph Algorithms for Computer Science Education)
For my Thesis on Videogames for teaching Graph-related Algorithms.

The game is being developed in the Godot Game Engine.

The idea of this game is to make the steps a computer must perform in order to do graph-related algorithms, like  BFS, DFS. (Prim and Kruskal were proposed but not finished due to UX problems).

The user must follow a sequence of instructions to perform the given algorithm. Each algorithm represents a level.

A release can be found at the following link:

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!


## Folders:

* Godot contains the Godot project.

* Propuesta has the first proposal of my thesis, done during the first semester.

* ReunionesYAvances has information about meetings, user testing and so on. It's all in Spanish and it has no documentation.

* Tesis has the Latex code for generating the last pdf. The final thesis is main.pdf.
The thesis can be found by following the path: Tesis/main.pdf
